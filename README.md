# My first web page and JS programming project 'pathfinder'
## Implemented in April 2021
Started as a C++ developer, but decided to showcase my abilities with algorithms in JS as it was easier to visually implement what I had in mind with it other than with C++.
I didn't know much about JS and this code is very well 'spaghettified', but I find it quite fun for a first project.
